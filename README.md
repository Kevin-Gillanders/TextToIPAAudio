## TODO
- Allow a string to be provided to the program and using the lookup table create the audio playback
- Maybe aquire a different IPA audio data set
	- Create an IPA dataset recording suite?
- Read up more on IPA pronounciations and modifications when proceeded and followed by different sounds


## Ideas
- [ ] Look into using ML to create a translation to IPA instead of using hard coded datasets
	- Decision trees seem to me used, along with neural networks
	- English doesn't lend itself well to automatic translation due to the messy nature of the language
- [ ] Create a translation between Recieved Pronounciation and :
	- [ ] Hiberno english
	- [ ] Ulster english
	- [ ] Scottish english
